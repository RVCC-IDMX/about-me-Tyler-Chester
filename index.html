<h2> Biography: </h2>
<div>

<p>
  Hello! My name is Tyler Chester, and I am currently enrolled in my second semester at RVCC as an information technology major. This was one of my first coding classes that I have ever taken, and I feel so proud to be able to say I created my own website! I am also currently enrolled in a Java coding class, but I prefer this one as it feels more fulfilling. I aspire to be in the I.T. field for my future career. Originally, I was not sure what I was interested in and struggled to pick a career path. However, I had taken inspiration from my dad, who is also in the same field. My entire life, I have seen him able to fix almost any problem he had run into, and he credits all of his problem-solving skills to his time working in IT. Another very important role model in my life is my good friend Michael, who is a West Point recruit. Growing up with him, I have been able to see him grow and become the strong and charismatic person he is today. Throughout all the low points in my life, he has been there for me and helped push me to be the best version of myself. Many of my favorite hobbies are because we had started them together. During COVID, he had made an at-home gym, and I would walk over every day to lift with him. My love for music can also be attributed to our friendship as we created many playlists together and constantly send each other new songs. The guidance and encouragement from these people have shaped my aspirations, and I look forward to embracing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in my pursuit of a fulfilling career in the IT field.</p>

<h3>An Excerpt From Dracula</h3>

<div>

<p>"There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. 'See! see! I prove; I prove.' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay, had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again? We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God's sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no; but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What say you?"</p>
<p>Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man's hand can speak for itself; it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music.</p>
