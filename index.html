<h2> Biography: </h2>
<div>

<p>
  Hello! My name is Tyler Chester, and I am currently enrolled in my second semester at RVCC as an information technology major. This was one of my first coding classes that I have ever taken, and I feel so proud to be able to say I created my own website! I am also currently enrolled in a Java coding class, but I prefer this one as it feels more fulfilling. I aspire to be in the I.T. field for my future career. Originally, I was not sure what I was interested in and struggled to pick a career path. However, I had taken inspiration from my dad, who is also in the same field. My entire life, I have seen him able to fix almost any problem he had run into, and he credits all of his problem-solving skills to his time working in IT. Another very important role model in my life is my good friend Michael, who is a West Point recruit. Growing up with him, I have been able to see him grow and become the strong and charismatic person he is today. Throughout all the low points in my life, he has been there for me and helped push me to be the best version of myself. Many of my favorite hobbies are because we had started them together. During COVID, he had made an at-home gym, and I would walk over every day to lift with him. My love for music can also be attributed to our friendship as we created many playlists together and constantly send each other new songs. The guidance and encouragement from these people have shaped my aspirations, and I look forward to embracing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in my pursuit of a fulfilling career in the IT field.</p>

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of web design, staying ahead of the curve is essential to creating captivating user experiences. One of the most powerful tools in a web designer's arsenal is CSS animation. With CSS animation, you can breathe life into your designs, adding movement and interactivity that engages users and enhances usability. CSS animation allows you to animate HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash. It works by changing the style properties of an element over a specified duration, creating the illusion of motion. CSS animations are lightweight, performant, and compatible with modern web browsers, making them an ideal choice for adding dynamic effects to your website. CSS animation can be used in a variety of ways to enhance your web design. Some examples of them would be hover effects, page transitions, loading animations, scroll animations, and animated illustrations. Hover effects add subtle animations to elements when users hover over them, providing visual feedback and enhancing interactivity. For example, you can animate the color, size, or position of a button when a user hovers over it. This can be seen within the website here when you hover over times such as the logo in the corner, the avatar, and the submit button they all increase slightly in size. Page transitions create smooth transitions between different sections of your website to improve navigation and create a seamless browsing experience. You can animate elements such as page transitions, sliding panels, or modal windows. Loading animations keep users engaged while content is loading by adding animated spinners or progress bars. CSS animations can provide visual feedback that something is happening behind the scenes, reducing user frustration. Scroll animations enhance storytelling and draw attention to important content by triggering animations as users scroll down the page. This technique can be used to reveal content, trigger parallax effects, or add depth to your design. An example of this can also be seen in this website through the use of the nav bar. When an item is clicked there is a smooth scrolling animation rather than an abrupt change to the screen. Animated illustrations bring static illustrations to life by adding subtle animations to elements such as characters, objects, or backgrounds. This can create a more immersive experience and make your website memorable. Creating a CSS animation involves several steps, each contributing to the overall effectiveness and visual appeal of the animation. First, you must plan your animation. Before diving into coding, it's important to have a clear vision of what you want to achieve with your animation. Consider things such as the type of animation, the elements you want to animate, and the desired timing and duration. Next you should identify the HTML elements you want to animate. These could be buttons, text, images, or any other element on your webpage. Then you should decide on the specific properties you want to animate, such as size, position, color, opacity, or rotation. You can animate multiple properties simultaneously to create complex effects. It is then time to choose the animation technique.  There are 3 techniques to choose from, the first is a transition which transitions smoothly between two states of an element, such as changing its color or size when hovered over, secondly there is keyframe animation in which you define key frames at various points in the animation timeline to specify the element's styles at each keyframe, lastly there is shorthand animation which combines multiple animation properties into a single shorthand declaration for more concise code. Once you've planned the animation and identified the elements and properties to animate, it's time to write the CSS code. Using CSS selectors, you can target the elements you want to animate and apply the animation properties accordingly. It is then important to define the timing and duration of the animation using CSS properties such as duration, delay, timing-function, and iteration-count. This determines how fast or slow the animation plays and when it starts. After writing the CSS code, test the animation in different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. Make adjustments as needed to refine the animation and achieve the desired effect. The final steps would be to optimize your code by reducing the number of unnecessary animations and to document your code for future reference and maintenance. By following these steps, you can create great CSS animations that enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of your website.</p>
